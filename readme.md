# TV Slideshow

A slideshow, formatted like a PowerPoint presentation, for television screens.  It looks best on a large TV screen with 1920x1080 resolution (16:9 aspect ratio).

This was initially designed to be used with BrightSign [HTML5](https://www.brightsign.biz/key-features/html5) presentations (model number [XT243](https://www.brightsign.biz/digital-signage-products/legacy-products/XT-Product-line/XT243), firmware version [8.0.94](https://brightsignbiz.s3.amazonaws.com/firmware/release_notes/8.0/8.0.94/OS%208.0.94%20Release%20Notes.pdf)). Previous firmware versions do not seem to handle arrow functions (7.1.65 in particular) .
